# Assignment 23

Given an array of ints, return the largest value. You can assume the array length will be at least 1.

Please create a method called `maxVal` that takes an array of ints as a parameter. Your method should return the largest integer value, not the index.

`public static int maxVal(int[] nums)`

In `main` populate the array and output the result by calling the method.

### Sample Outputs

```
// array
int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};

// output
Max value is 3.
```

```
// array
int[] nums = {5, 7, 2, 9, 3};

// output
Max value is 9. 
```

### Grading

As always, your program will be graded on its functionality according to the project specifications and proper code style.
